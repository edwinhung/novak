        (Serbian: Новак Ђоковић, Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk dʑôːkoʋitɕ]
        ⓘ;[6] born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player.
        Djokovic has been ranked No. 1 for a record total of 428 weeks in a
        record 13 different years by the ATP, and finished as the year-end No. 1
        a record eight times.[7] Djokovic has won a record 24 Grand Slam men's
        singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Overall,
        he has won 98 singles titles, including a record 71 Big Titles: 24
        majors, a record 40 Masters, and a record seven ATP Finals. Djokovic is
        the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four
        majors at once across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the
        only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to
        complete a Career Golden Masters, a feat he has achieved twice.
