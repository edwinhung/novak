        (Serbian: Новак Ђоковић, Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk dʑôːkoʋitɕ]
        ⓘ;[6] born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player.
        Djokovic has been ranked No. 1 for a record total of 428 weeks in a
        record 13 different years by the ATP, and finished as the year-end No. 1
        a record eight times.[7] Djokovic has won a record 24 Grand Slam men's
        singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Overall,
        he has won 98 singles titles, including a record 71 Big Titles: 24
        majors, a record 40 Masters, and a record seven ATP Finals. Djokovic is
        the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four
        majors at once across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the
        only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to
        complete a Career Golden Masters, a feat he has achieved twice.

        Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he
        disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive
        majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010,
        Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and,
        as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was referred to as
        the "Big Three" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended
        to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five
        Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained
        the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the
        decade.[8] In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching a
        single-season record 15 consecutive finals, winning a season-record 10
        Big Titles while having a record 31 victories over the top-10
        players.[9] His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open,
        where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year
        Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all
        four majors simultaneously[10] and setting a rankings points record of
        16,950. In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened
        his results until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where he won the
        title while ranked No. 21 in the world. Djokovic has continued to be a
        dominant force on the tour since then, winning 12 major titles and
        completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. Due to his
        opposition to COVID-19 vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many
        tournaments in 2022,[11] notably the Australian Open and the US Open;
        two major events he was the favourite to win.[12][13] One year after the
        Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a successful comeback to
        reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[14] and shortly after he
        claimed the French Open to take the outright record for most men's
        singles majors won in history.[15]

      <h2>Early and personal life</h2>
      <p>
        Novak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR
        Yugoslavia, to Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic. He is of paternal
        Serbian and maternal Croatian descent.[22] His two younger brothers,
        Marko and Djordje, have also played professional tennis.[23]

        Djokovic began playing tennis at the age of four,[23] after his parents
        gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, which his father said
        became "the most beloved toy in his life".[24] His parents then sent him
        to a tennis camp in Novi Sad.[24][25] In the summer of 1993, as a
        six-year-old, he was sent to a tennis camp organized by the Teniski Klub
        Partizan and overseen by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić[25][26] at
        Mount Kopaonik, where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food
        parlour.[24][27][28] Genčić worked with Djokovic over the following six
        years, convincing him to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the
        single hand used by his idol, Pete Sampras.[2][29][30] Djokovic has
        credited Genčić for "shaping my mind as a human being, but also as a
        professional".[31][32]
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Yugoslav Wars in the late 1990s, Serbia had to endure
        embargoes[32] and NATO bombings[23][27][29] because of the Kosovo
        War.[23][33] At one point he had to train inside a disused swimming pool
        converted into a tennis court.[34] Due to his rapid development, Genčić
        contacted Nikola Pilić and in September 1999 Djokovic moved to the Pilić
        tennis academy in Oberschleißheim, Germany, spending four years
        there.[2][27][35] Pilić made him serve against a wall for several months
        to improve his technique, and he had him working with a rubber exercise
        band for a year to improve flexibility in his wrist.[27] One of the
        players he trained with at the Niki Pilić academy was future world No.
        10 Ernests Gulbis, with whom he allegedly had a fiery rivalry.[36][37]
